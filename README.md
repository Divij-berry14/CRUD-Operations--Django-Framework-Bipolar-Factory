# Crud-Operations--Django-Framework-Bipolar-Factory

Here I have made an Book App where the user can upload a new book with fields like Name, Image, Description, Email id and Author.
Basically this project follows the CRUDE Operations with Django Framerwork. CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete).
It has 4 different urls.
1. "/"- Index page
2."upload/"- Page to upload
3."update/book_id"- Page to update the already exisitng book details
4. "delete/book_id"- Page to delete the book
